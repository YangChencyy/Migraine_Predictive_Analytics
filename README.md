## General Description of the project

This project aims to identify biomarkers for migraine patients based on voluntary data collected through an app called GeoPain.  Long-term we would embed this into the GeoPain app for real-time diagnosis and treatment plans. The project is mainly programmed in R.

## Background

Migraine is a complex pain disorder that impacts the life of a great part of our world population. It leads to sensitization of cranial and extracranial body regions, and patients often complain of other pain comorbidities. One of the common co-existent ailments in migraineurs is temporomandibular pain disorder (TMD) that impairs the masticatory muscles and joints with pain and dysfunction for crucial daily activities like eating and talking.  However, early detection and prognostication of migraine and TMD are challenging because of the heterogeneity of clinical presentations and overlapping symptoms across broad head and orofacial anatomical structures, delaying their diagnosis and proper multidisciplinary treatment.

Our goal is to perform unsupervised classification to corroborate a patient's self-diagnosis. Predictive analytics is performed after synthetic data rebalancing by our Compressive Big Data Analytics -CBDA protocol. The unsupervised and supervised classification will guide power ranking of the predictive features for classifying migraine vs TMD patients.
